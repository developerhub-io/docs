Create a changelog for your docs using our Changelogs native feature.

Check out our own changelog: $link[changelog,1,auto$].

## Creating a Changelog

To create a changelog:

- From the left sidebar, choose Changelogs {% icon classes="fas fa-clock" /%}
- Click "Create new changelog".
- Give it a title and click Create.

You can now change the path and description of the changelog from its settings {% icon classes="fas fa-cog" /%}.

## Adding a Post

To add a new post to the changelog, click on New Post. Each post has a label, a slug to be accessed from, and contents. The contents of a post are the same as documentation pages and can include any block.

## RSS Feed

Changelogs can be subscribed to through an RSS feed. This enables users to remain up-to-date with all the new posts.
