Create a changelog for your docs using our Changelogs native feature.

Check out our own changelog: [auto$](/product-updates).

{% callout type="info" title="How is this different from writing a changelog on a page?" %}
Changelogs operate independently of specific versions, in contrast to pages. When a changelog is included within a page, it can quickly become outdated as soon as you clone a version and commence work on a new one.
{% /callout %}

## Creating a Changelog

To create a changelog:

- From the left sidebar, choose Changelogs {% icon classes="fas fa-clock" /%}
- Click "Create new changelog".
- Give it a title and click Create.

You can now change the path and description of the changelog from its settings {% icon classes="fas fa-cog" /%}.

## Adding a Post

To add a new post to the changelog, click on New Post. Each post has a label, a slug to be accessed from, and contents. The contents of a post are the same as documentation pages and can include any block.

## RSS Feed

Changelogs can be subscribed to through an RSS feed. This enables users to remain up-to-date with all the new posts.

## Importing Posts

Posts can be imported in [markdoc format](/support-center/markdoc-format#changelog) by clicking the import button {% icon classes="fas fa-download" /%} next to the changelog title.

Importing posts only adds posts to the changelog. It does not remove any posts.

## Exporting Changelog

All posts in a changelog can be exported by clicking the export button {% icon classes="fas fa-upload" /%} next to the changelog title. Posts are exported in [markdoc format](/support-center/markdoc-format).
