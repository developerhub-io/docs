Categories make it easier to segment your documentation. You can see an example of categories on the left hand-side, such as "Start Here".

## Adding Categories

To add a category:

- In your documentation index, find the last index labelled "New" and click on the menu icon {% icon classes="fas fa-ellipsis-v" /%} next to it.
- Click on **Category** {% icon classes="fas fa-tag" /%}.
- Give it a title.

## Deleting Categories

To delete a category, click the menu icon {% icon classes="fas fa-ellipsis-v" /%} next to it in the index, then select Delete {% icon classes="fas fa-trash" /%}.

{% callout type="info" title="Info" %}
The category must be emptied before it can be deleted. Either move all indices under it to another category, or delete them.
{% /callout %}

## Renaming Categories

To rename a category:

- Click on the menu icon {% icon classes="fas fa-ellipsis-v" /%} next to it in the index.
- Select Edit {% icon classes="fas fa-pencil-alt" /%}.
- Give it a new title.

## Collapse Settings

To make categories collapse, check [Collapsible Categories](/support-center/documentation-settings#collapsible-categories).

## Re-ordering Categories

To re-order a category, drag and drop it anywhere in the index.

{% callout type="info" title="Info" %}
Categories are only top-level elements in the index.
{% /callout %}

## Separators

Separators act as a divider between a category and other index items. For example, if you wish to provide links below a category, but not in the category itself, then you can add a separator to allow the links to be top-level items.

## Labels

Labels are just like categories, but they do not really contain the pages under them, thus they do not expand nor collapse. Literally, they're just pieces of text you can add to the index to group pages.
