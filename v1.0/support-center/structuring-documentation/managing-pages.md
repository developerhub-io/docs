Each %product% documentation can have infinite pages. We support a two-level structure of pages which makes it easier for the reader to navigate through.

## Adding Page

To add a new page to a documentation, click on New then Page {% icon classes="far fa-file" /%} at the bottom of the index. After writing the title and contents, you will be able to save the page. The new page will be saved at the bottom of the index, but you can re-order it.

## Adding Subpage

To add a new subpage to an existing parent page, click on the plus sign {% icon classes="fas fa-plus" /%} that is next to the parent page. After writing the title and contents, you will be able to save the page. The new subpage will be saved at the bottom of the parent page index, but you can re-order it.

## Re-ordering Pages

To re-order a page, simply drag and drop it anywhere in the index.

{% callout type="info" title="Info" %}
Parent pages with subpages cannot be re-ordered into another parent page
{% /callout %}

{% callout type="warning" title="Automatic Save" %}

{% /callout %}

## Moving Page to Another Documentation

To move a page to another documentation, click on the menu icon {% icon classes="fas fa-ellipsis-v" /%} next to it, then select Move {% icon classes="fas fa-file-import" /%}. You will be prompted with the different documentations that you have under that version.

If you move a parent page, all subpages will be moved with it as well.

## Linking Pages

Pages can link other pages in the documentation, see [Page Linking](/support-center/page-linking) to learn more.

## Editing Page Slug

The page slug is the part of the URL which identifies that page. For example, the current page has the slug `managing-pages`. The page slug is kept as-is after a title is set first, regardless of the next changes to the title. This helps in maintaining the SEO ranking for that page.

If you needed to change the page slug:

- From the index, select the page whose slug is to be changed.
- Under the page title in the editor, click on the slug {% icon classes="fas fa-link" /%}.
- Set the new slug.

- From the index, click on the menu icon {% icon classes="fas fa-ellipsis-v" /%}next to the page to have its index renamed.
- Select Edit Title {% icon classes="fas fa-pencil-alt" /%}
- Type in the Title and confirm.
