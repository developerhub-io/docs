%product% provides powerful tools to enable you to easily move your content around, edit it and restructure it, all out of the editor.

## Import Sources

You can import to %product% from many sources:

- %product% export (available for entire project imports and one page imports)
- [Markdown](/support-center/external-sources#markdown-import)
- [ReadMe](/support-center/external-sources#readme-import)
- [Zendesk](/support-center/import-from-zendesk)
- Other sources, such as: [HTML](/support-center/external-sources#importing-from-html), [Confluence](/support-center/external-sources#importing-from-confluence), [Word](/support-center/external-sources#importing-from-word-documents) or [other external sources](/support-center/external-sources).

## Import DeveloperHub.io Export

To import documentation, follow these steps:

- Make sure your import files are [structured](/support-center/importing-documentation#structuring-files) as required.
- From the sidebar, open Project settings {% icon classes="fas fa-layer-group inv-icon" /%}
- Click on Import {% icon classes="fas fa-download" /%}
- Choose %product%.

Importing could take a few seconds up to a minute.

{% callout type="info" title="Info" %}
All imports add versions. Versions, documentations and pages are never overwritten.
{% /callout %}

## Import a page into %product%

You can import a single Markdown or a [Darkdown](/support-center/importing-documentation#darkdown-format) page at a time into %product%.

To import one page, follow these steps:

- From the index, choose the page to import over, or create a new page and save it.
- Under the title, click on Import icon {% icon classes="fas fa-cloud-download-alt" /%}
- Choose the file to be imported.

## Structuring Files

To import documentation from %product% export into %product%, you must structure your files as such:

{% image url="https://image-archive.developerhub.io/image/upload/7458/g7vrypbxvdyysrbhpabz/1557871279.png" mode="responsive" height="704" width="722" %}
{% /image %}

Where, for example:

- `v1.0` is the name of your version.
- `Support Center` is the title of your documentation.
- `1 Getting Started.md` is a documentation page written in Darkdown format. Its order is 1st in Support Center documentation and its title is `Getting Started`. `Getting Started` folder indicates that `1 Getting Started.md` is a parent page, and it has a subpage titled `First Steps`.
- `1 Formatting Text.md`, `2 Keyboard Shortcuts.md` and `3 Using Markdown.md` are all subpages of Writing Documentation page.
- `settings.json` is `Support Center` documentation settings file. Settings file is an optional file.

Every parent page should have a a Markdown file and a folder with the same exact name.

The orders must be incremental and starting from 1. If an order is not supplied in the file name, then no index order is guaranteed.

Additionally, you may add OpenAPI spec files in a folder named `refs` in the version folder.

All the files in the import must be compressed into a ZIP file.

## Darkdown Format

Darkdown Format is simple. Each file must contain a header and optionally content.

### Header

Each file contains a header depending on the index element being described.

- Page:

{% code %}
{% tab language="yaml" %}
---
type: page
title: Callouts
listed: true
slug: callouts
description: <SEO description>
index_title: Callouts
hidden: 
keywords: keyword1,keyword2
tags: tag1,tag2
---
{% /tab %}
{% /code %}

- Category:

{% code %}
{% tab language="yaml" %}
---
type: category
title: Start Here
---
{% /tab %}
{% /code %}

- Link:

{% code %}
{% tab language="yaml" %}
---
type: link
title: Go to DeveloperHub.io
url: https://developerhub.io
---
{% /tab %}
{% /code %}

- Separator:

{% code %}
{% tab language="none" %}
---
type: separator
---
{% /tab %}
{% /code %}

### Content

Category, link and separator elements do not have content. Pages do have content, and it can be pure Markdown or Markdown mixed with our powerful blocks annotation.

Draft and published page contents can be defined in an export and it is annotated by a `---draft` or `---published` header, such as:

{% code %}
{% tab language="yaml" %}
---draft

Draft content is here

---published

Published content is here
{% /tab %}
{% /code %}

An example of published content that contains a heading, text and a code block would be:

{% code %}
{% tab language="yaml" %}
---published
## Code Block Example

A Hello World code block:

$plugin[{
    "type": "code-block",
    "data": {
        "languageBlocks": [
            {
                "code": "console.log(\"Hello World\");",
                "language": "javascript"
            },
            {
                "code": "print(\"Hello World!\")",
                "language": "python"
            },
            {
                "code": "package main\n\nimport \"fmt\" \n\nfunc main() {\n     fmt.Println(\"hello world\")\n}",
                "language": "go"
            }
        ]
    }
}]$
{% /tab %}
{% /code %}

### Blocks

As Markdown does not include many of our powerful features, so we created Darkdown formatting to enable such features. All blocks are exported as such:

{% code %}
{% tab language="yaml" %}
$plugin[{
     "type": "<<type>>",
     "data": "<<data>>"
}]$
{% /tab %}
{% /code %}

Where type is one of `code-block`, `image`, `video`, `table`, `github-code`, `synced-block`, `tab-block`, `index-list` and `custom-html`. Data definition depends on the type.

### Inline Blocks

Additionally, inline blocks are exported in Darkdown format such as [badges](/support-center/badges), [icons](/support-center/icons) and [keyboard keys](/support-center/keyboard-keys). For example,

This badge: {% badge type="success" text="Great!" /%} would be formatted as:

{% code %}
{% tab language="yaml" %}
{% badge type="success" text="Great!" /%}
{% /tab %}
{% /code %}

And this icon: {% icon classes="fas fa-adjust" /%} would be formatted as:

{% code %}
{% tab language="yaml" %}
{% icon classes="fas fa-adjust" /%}
{% /tab %}
{% /code %}

Feel free to export any page to understand the formatting of its contents.

## Table Format

Tables are exported in Markdown format, except if column width is set then we use the Darkdown format in order to retain the information.

The Markdown format for tables used for imports and exports are as such:

{% code %}
{% tab language="none" %}
| Browser | Mode | Is Supported? | Remarks | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| Chrome | Desktop | Yes | Fully supported | 
| Chrome | Mobile | Yes | Fully supported |
{% /tab %}
{% /code %}

Requirements:

1. All rows start and end with `|`.
2. Every column is separated by `|`.
3. A header row must exist.
4. A separator row under header must exist.
5. Multiline cells use `\n` to separate lines.

## Image Import

If an image is referenced in Markdown format in one of the pages, it will automatically be downloaded to our servers and served from our content delivery network.

Images can be uploaded from two sources:

- HTTP, or
- Local

Regardless of the image source, each image must be at maximum 10MB in size. Otherwise, the import will fail.

{% callout type="warning" title="Warning" %}
By importing images on %product%, you are responsible to ensure that you have rights to all data.
{% /callout %}

### HTTP Image Import

To import images from the internet, they should be referenced as such:

{% code %}
{% tab language="markdown" %}
HTTP Image:

![Image Caption](https://example.com/image.png)
{% /tab %}
{% /code %}

It will then be downloaded from its source, and uploaded to our content delivery network. The image must be accessible online publicly, otherwise the import will fail.

### Local Image Import

To import images locally from the provided ZIP file, they must exist in a folder named `assets` alongside the versions.

They should be referenced as such:

{% code %}
{% tab language="markdown" %}
Local Image:

![Image Caption](/assets/image.png)
{% /tab %}
{% /code %}

Inside `assets` folder, any folder structure is allowed.
