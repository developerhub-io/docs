## What does the Integration do?

Our Slack integration notifies your team on a Slack channel you choose instantly of the following changes:

- Page created, edited and published.
- Version created.
- API reference created, edited and published.

It also updates you whenever you receive [feedback](/support-center/feedback) on an hourly-basis.
