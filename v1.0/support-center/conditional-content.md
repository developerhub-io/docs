Conditional content blocks let you control who can see a given block of content on your page based on [variables](/support-center/variables). These variables can be passed in via [custom login](/support-center/custom-login).

{% synced id="beta-feature" %}
{% /synced %}

## Create conditional content

To add a conditional block:

{% synced id="open-block-menu" %}
{% /synced %}

- Select **Conditional Block**.
- Add the content as needed inside the conditional block.
- Click on the expression in the top right side to add conditions using the expression builder.

## Setting Conditions

In the expression builder, you can add as many conditions as needed. Each condition is a check that a variable matches a value. All conditions must be satisfied for the conditional block to show.
