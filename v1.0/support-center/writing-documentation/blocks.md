No documentation can be complete with just text.

To add more than text to your documentation, just hit {% key key="/" /%} anywhere in your documentation, search, and select the block you need.

The blocks menu will show, just like this one:

{% image url="https://uploads.developerhub.io/prod/02/ek4dchom06zasu70pblhjmnn80svgue7v9mws01hir8t8bgcy26148e2ou9dkhcq.png" mode="responsive" height="914" width="540" %}
{% /image %}

%product% supports the following blocks:

- [Code blocks](/support-center/code-blocks)
- [Callouts](/support-center/callouts)
- [Images](/support-center/images)
- [Videos](/support-center/videos)
- [Tables](/support-center/tables)
- [auto$](/support-center/synced-blocks)
- [Custom HTML](/support-center/custom-html)
- [auto$](/support-center/tabs)
- [auto$](/support-center/github-code)
- [auto$](/support-center/index-list)
- [Separators](/support-center/separators)

{% callout type="warning" title="Block menu not showing?" %}
Then where you are typing has text formatting (bold/italic/inline code) on. Remove any text formatting on the cursor position before trying to add blocks.

Formatting does carry from the previous line. To resolve this, you probably just need to hit  Backspace  then  â†µ  again.
{% /callout %}

## Inline Blocks

Also, you can add inline blocks to your documentation. Inline blocks go on the same line as text. %product% supports the following inline blocks:

- [Link to Page](/support-center/page-linking)
- [Variables](/support-center/variables)
- [auto$](/support-center/glossary)
- [Badges](/support-center/badges)
- [Font Awesome Icons](/support-center/icons)
- [auto$](/support-center/keyboard-keys)

Inline blocks can be added by typing "/" anywhere in the documentation as well.

## Emojis

We have support for emojis everywhere, so if you felt the need to express using emojis then don't be shy ðŸ˜„

## Adding Empty Line around Blocks

To add an empty line above or below a block:

- Hover over or under the centre of the block. An arrow {% icon classes="far fa-caret-square-down" /%} would show.
- Click on the arrow to add an empty line.
