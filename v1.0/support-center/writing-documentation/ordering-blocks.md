All blocks can be re-ordered on the page using drag and drop.

## How to re-order blocks?

Drag and drop any block from the {% icon classes="fas fa-arrows-alt" /%} icon at the top right of the block.

## Copying Blocks

Blocks can be duplicated inside the same page by clicking the duplicate icon at the top right side of the block. 

To copy a block to another page, you can either highlight it using a text selection or simply triple-click on the block. Once selected, copy the block and then paste it into your desired destination.

Alternatively, you can also follow these steps:

1. [Export the source page](/support-center/exporting-documentation#exporting-a-page) and the destination page.
2. Copy the equivalent [darkdown](/support-center/exporting-documentation#darkdown) text from source page to destination page.
3. [Import](/support-center/importing-documentation#import-a-page-into-product) the destination page.
