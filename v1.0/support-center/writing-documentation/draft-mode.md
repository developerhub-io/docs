Draft mode empowers your editors with enhanced capabilities, offering the flexibility to write without restrictions and the ability to publish content at the optimal moment. It serves as a staging environment for pages, enabling ongoing work and review until they are fully prepared for publication.

Writing documentation with a pen is a thing of the past. Editors seek the ability to make adjustments seamlessly without the fear of making errors.

### How is it different than changing publish setting?

Unpublishing a page completely renders it inaccessible to readers. In contrast, a page can remain published with the latest stable content while simultaneously having a draft mode that you can continue to work on. This allows for a seamless transition between publishing content and developing new updates without disrupting access to the current version.

## Page Life-Cycle

Each page could have three states:

- [Unpublished](/support-center/unlisting) {% icon classes="fas fa-circle red-text" /%} : The page has never been published or was unpublished.
- Listed, published.
- Listed, in draft mode {% icon classes="far fa-file-alt" /%}.

## Listed, published

Once you publish the unlisted draft page, it becomes listed. Listed means that it is visible to your readers. Also, the changes that were in draft mode are now applied and published.

{% /image %}

The **Publish** {% icon classes="fas fa-forward" /%} button will indicate that the page is published.

## Listed, in draft mode

If you edit a page that was listed and published, it goes back into draft mode. That means that your readers still can access the page, and can read the contents of the page as when it was listed, but your teammates can keep on making edits that are only visible to them.

Publish when you are ready!

{% /image %}

Draft pages show a draft page icon in the index, and the control buttons allow you to publish.

## Draft Pages History

Every draft is saved in the page history and is indicated as a draft version. To discard all draft changes, and to revert to the published version:

1. Click on {% icon classes="fas fa-history" /%} Show Published under the page title. 
2. Make any edit.
3. Save the page again and publish it.
