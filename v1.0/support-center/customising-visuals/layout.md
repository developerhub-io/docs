%product% documentations have two layouts:

- Minimal
- Wide

Wide layout is the most common layout and is recommended.

## Minimal Layout

Minimal layout is for small documentation and does not show a table of contents. This is how it looks like:

{% image url="https://image-archive.developerhub.io/image/upload/-1/utcqo1u0vkka5pda1deg/1548529201.png" mode="600" height="2263" width="3558" %}
{% /image %}

## Wide Layout

Wide layout is recommended for larger documentations with longer page content that needs to be navigated through.

It is the current layout of this documentation. This is how it looks like:

{% image url="https://image-archive.developerhub.io/image/upload/-1/thy56y9ykprxo6x6gzl9/1548529206.png" mode="600" height="2263" width="3558" %}
{% /image %}

The wide layout features a table of contents which outlines all the headings that are available in the page, and provides a shortcut for navigating there. The table of contents only shows when the browser window width is greater than 1240px.

## Changing Layout

Each documentation can have a different layout, to change the layout:

- Go to Documentation {% icon classes="fas fa-book inv-icon" /%} in the sidebar.
- Next to the title, click on Settings {% icon classes="fas fa-cog" /%}
- Under Layout, choose the preferred layout.
