## AI Search Features

{% glossary term="AI Search" /%} allows the readers to ask a questions about the docs and get GPT-powered responses with answers right from the docs. Features of AI search: 

- Answers from both documentation and API references.
- Can ask questions in any language, regardless if the documentation is written using that language or not.
- Responds using the language of the question.
- Provides a source list for further reading.

## AI Search Experience

When [AI Search is enabled](/support-center/ai-search#enabling-ai-search), the search bar would prompt the reader to "Search or ask a question" instead of "Search". The AI search would be activated when the reader:

- Presses the enter key or,
- Types in text in a question form (such as start with "How" "Where" "Why") or,
- Types in a question mark or,
- Clicks on the AI prompt "Press enter to ask".

When the reader presses enter, the question would be answered according to the docs available with explanations and examples if possible. The sources would be listed after the question is answered. 

## Enabling AI Search

To enable/disable AI search:

- From the left sidebar, choose **Project Settings** {% icon classes="fas fa-layer-group inv-icon" /%}.
- Under AI Features, check or uncheck **Enable AI search**.

Once AI search is enabled, it might take a couple of minutes until it is useable.

## Search Update Frequency

New or deleted content would be effectively available within 30 minutes for AI search.

## Validating Responses

To validate responses provided by AI Search, a log of all questions and answers can be downloaded.

To download the log:

- Under AI Search, click on the {% icon classes="fas fa-download" /%} icon.

## Limitations of AI Search

- Only indexes and shows on the default version of the documentation.
- Prone to provide incorrect, misleading or incomplete answers.
- No analytics are collected yet.
- AI Search only works on [Next UI](/support-center/customising-visuals#next-ui).

## What data is sent to OpenAI?

When enabling AI search for a project, the entirety of the content that readers can access is sent to OpenAI. Whenever content is re-indexed, the new content would be sent to OpenAI.
