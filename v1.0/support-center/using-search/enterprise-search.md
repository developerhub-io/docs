Enterprise accounts can have multi-project search activated on their organisation. This allows them to:

- Setup one project to be a [global project](/support-center/enterprise-search#global-search), where searching from this project will search in one or more other projects under the organisation, or
- Setup search on [multiple projects](/support-center/enterprise-search#column-search) to view results from each one of the projects.

## Global Search

When using global search, one project will be assigned to be a global project. This project will probably be the entry project of the docs site that navigates the readers into the other projects. With enterprise search, you can setup this project to search into all other projects in a list-fashion in which all search results are merged and sorted in one list (like the default search appearance). This works for organisations with a small number of projects as well as tens of projects.

## Column Search

When using column search, searching on one project will search on multiple projects and show the results divided in different columns in the search result box. This works best for organisations with two or three projects maximum.

When using column search, we can specify which exact version and section to search in.

## Global Analytics

We are able to differentiate between searches that originate from a different project than the one being searched in. When your organisation is setup to be using [global search](/support-center/enterprise-search#global-search), the [search analytics](/support-center/search-analytics) would display data as follows:

- For global project: Data for all searches made through the global project on all other projects.
- For other projects: Data for searches made on that project specifically, excluding any data for searches made through the global project even if it was for that project.

This would ensure that your search analytics data remains accurate and useable.

## Setting up Enterprise Search

Contact your account manager to have enterprise search setup.
