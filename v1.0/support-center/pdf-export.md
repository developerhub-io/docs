If your readers cannot access the documentation online, then you can provide them with a PDF export of the documentation.

## How to export to PDF?

PDFs are exported by version. To export a PDF:

- From the sidebar, choose Version {% icon classes="fas fa-code-branch inv-icon" /%}
- Next to the title, click on Settings {% icon classes="fas fa-cog" /%}
- Next to Export to PDF, choose Manage {% icon classes="far fa-file-pdf" /%}
- In the PDF Exports window, click on Generate New PDF.

Once a PDF export job starts, you can see its progress in the PDF Exports window. When a job is finished, the job will be marked as Done, and you will be able to download the PDF.

## PDF Permalink

After you have at least one PDF generated, you can generate a permalink for PDF downloads of the version. The permalink would always download the latest PDF that you have generated. You can use that link publicly if you wish to allow your readers to download the latest PDF.

To get a permalink:

- From the sidebar, choose Version {% icon classes="fas fa-code-branch inv-icon" /%}
- Next to the title, click on Settings {% icon classes="fas fa-cog" /%}
- Next to Export to PDF, choose Manage {% icon classes="far fa-file-pdf" /%}
- In the PDF Exports window, click on Get Permalink {% icon classes="fas fa-link" /%}. The URL will be copied to your clipboard.

{% callout type="warning" title="Unique link" %}
The permalink is a unique link that cannot be revoked once someone has the link. Make sure you share the permalink with the right audience.
{% /callout %}

## Contents of the PDF

Our exported PDFs contain the following in order:

- A front cover, if you provide it,
- A page containing the project title and version name,
- Table of contents,
- The pages of each documentation,
- The API references,
- A back cover, if you provide it.

## Customisation of PDF

PDFs generated by %product% can be customised as follows:

- Add a front cover in PDF format.
- Add a back cover in PDF format.
- Add a logo at the top of each page, or a full-size banner in PNG format.
- Add a full-size banner at the footer of each page in PNG format.

To customise the PDF, [contact us](/support-center/contact-us) with the customisation assets.

## Limitations of PDF

- The PDFs are not interactive: The links in pages do not reference other pages in the PDF.
- Your project must be accessible through the custom domain, or the subdomain if the custom domain is not set.

## Troubleshooting Failed Exports

There are specific circumstances when a PDF export might fail. Rest assured that if a PDF export fails, we get notified of it and we can provide you with more information about its failure.

If your docs are hosted behind a firewall, make sure to whitelist `DeveloperHub.io PDF Exporter` user agent.
