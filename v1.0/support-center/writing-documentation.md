Writing documentation on %product% cannot be any easier. In your editor pages, click anywhere on the text in your documentation and start writing down. Everything will be shown to you just as it would in the live mode.

## Page Sections

Pages consist of a **title** and the **content**.

### Title

The title of the page will be visible in:

1. The index of the documentation.
2. The title of the browser tab.
3. The URL of the page.

So choose the title carefully to be meaningful to your readers.

### Content

The content of the page can consist of text, [tables](/support-center/tables), [images](/support-center/images), [links](/support-center/page-linking), [code blocks](/support-center/code-blocks), lists, [information boxes](/support-center/callouts), and much more!

## Saving

To save a page, hit the Save Draft button {% icon classes="fas fa-cloud-upload-alt" /%} at the bottom right. Your edits will be saved in [draft mode](/support-center/draft-mode) until you publish them. Every edit you make is saved in the [page history](/support-center/page-history).

When you are ready to publish the changes to your readers, click the Publish button {% icon classes="fas fa-forward" /%}.
