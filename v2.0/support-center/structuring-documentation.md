%product% documentation index contains six elements:

- [Pages](/support-center/managing-pages)
- [Categories](/support-center/categories)
- [Labels](/support-center/categories#labels)
- [auto$](/support-center/code-steps)
- [Links](/support-center/external-links)
- [Separators](/support-center/categories#separators)

All elements can be re-ordered by dragging and dropping them.

{% callout type="info" title="Long Dragging" %}
To re-order an element far away in the index, you can either:

- Click on its menu, choose Re-arrange, then a category to send the element to its bottom.
- Drag the element to the absolute top or absolute bottom of the index, the index will start scrolling automatically.
{% /callout %}

## Index Depth

Index can be as hierarchical as needed. Categories and separators are top-level elements. All other elements can be placed as parent or child elements.

{% callout type="info" title="Info" %}
We recommend keeping your documentation index as flat as possible. It's good UX!
