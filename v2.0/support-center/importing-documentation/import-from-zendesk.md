To import from Zendesk user guides, we have created an internal tool that will help you migrate from Zendesk to %product%.

## Importing from Zendesk

To import from Zendesk, follow these steps:

1. [Contact us](/support-center/contact-us) and provide us with the domain that is currently hosting your Zendesk user guides.
2. We will use our internal migration tool to make a %product%-compatible import. We will send this import file to you.
3. [Import](/support-center/importing-documentation#import-developerhubio-export) the file using %product% format.

## Notes about Zendesk Migration

Our internal migration tool is able to migrate articles from Zendesk into markdown format. This includes most content that is supported by Zendesk. The migration tool also would resolve all the links in the content so that all links are usable on %product%.

Zendesk has a different article structure than ours. To simplify the migration process, we flatten out the hierarchy. After you import the content into %product%, you can re-structure the pages as needed.

Furthermore, some features of Zendesk content is unsupported in %product%. We provide you with an errors file alongside the import file to indicate what issues have occurred during the migration so you can rectify as needed.
