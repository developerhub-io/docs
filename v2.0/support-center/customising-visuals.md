## Changing UI

%product% provides two UIs, %product% Original and %product% Next.

### Original UI

Original UI is the first UI of %product%, notable for its hovering search bar. The different sections and version are hidden behind dropdown, and the index has coloured categories.

{% /image %}

### Next UI

Next UI is the new UI. Next UI features a sleek design where different sections are visible in the top navigation, and a redesigned index with clearer margins and animation. It also providers a better [search experience](/support-center/using-search#next-ui-search).

{% image url="https://uploads.developerhub.io/prod/02/gisilvod2lm55ppsfekwri28qjfpk1deoc98ftqniqtb3juejaflqbidqhcf2ao1.png" mode="responsive" height="1432" width="2456" %}
{% /image %}

To change the UI:

1. Click on Project settings {% icon classes="fas fa-layer-group inv-icon" /%} in the sidebar.
2. Under Customisation, choose which UI to use.
3. Click Save.

{% callout type="info" title="Navigation bar sections" %}
In Next UI, the different sections are laid out in the top navigation bar. In mobile layout, they would collapse into a section picker dropdown.
{% /callout %}

## Changing Colours

The header, link and navigation colours are modifiable. To change the colours:

1. Click on Project settings {% icon classes="fas fa-layer-group inv-icon" /%} in the sidebar.
2. Under Customisation, choose which colour to change.
3. Pick the desired colour (We will warn you if the colour is not contrasting enough)
4. Click Save.

{% /image %}

{% callout type="info" title="Link Colour" %}
Make sure to set the link colour distinct from the font colour. This is usually your secondary brand colour. The text in your pages is almost black in light theme (white in dark theme), so you need a colourful link for it to be distinguished.
{% /callout %}

## Changing Font

To change the font of the entire project:

1. Click on Project settings {% icon classes="fas fa-layer-group inv-icon" /%} in the sidebar.
2. Under Customisation, edit the font.
3. Choose from the list of Google Fonts available. The font will be previewed immediately in the current documentation.

{% /image %}

{% callout type="warning" title="Automatic Saving" %}
Font will be automatically saved on change without prompt
{% /callout %}

{% callout type="info" title="Paid Plan" %}
Changing font is only a paid plan feature
{% /callout %}

### Not using Google Fonts?

If you are not using Google Fonts, you can serve your own font to your documentation portal as described in our own blog post: [Using your own Custom Font](https://developerhub.io/blog/using-your-own-font/)

### Font Weights Missing?

If the font you are using does not have all the font weights we expect, then you can change the actual font weight for an expected one. See [Font Weights](/support-center/custom-css#font-weights).
